What are these keywords or their use/differences
-module.exports
    -By default anything that you want to use in another file is encapsulated and you have to conciously tell
    Node.JS that you want to use it in another file with module.exports
-require
    -Pass it to a variable so that it holds the return of the require, for example it may hold a function, a model,
    a file anything a module. Require the entire file
-import
    -Import is used to import file that is exported in another file. Import is specific to save space
-exports
    -module.exports = add;
    let addFn = require('./add.js')
    and if you use the add function should work
    But if its
    exports = add;
    It wont work because you are givinng an alias to the keyword exports which doesnt contain anything

Things to know about React
What is a:
    -State
        -State is a plain JavaScript object used by React to represent an information about the componentâ€™s
         current situation. State is not used directly, setState is used. SetSTate is a request rather an immediate
         command to update. SetSTate is asychronous 
    -Components
        -Components are small pieces that make up your application in React. You can see a UI broken down into multiple
         individual pieces called components and work on them independently and merge them all in a parent component
         which will be your final UI.
         -Two types of components, for example functional components and class components
    -Functional Component/ Class Component
        -We can create a functional component in React by writing a javascript function. These functions may or may not
         receive data as parameters.
        -The functional components are not aware of the other components in your program whereas the class components can 
         work with each other. We can pass data from one class component to other class components
    -JSX
        -JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is simply a syntax extension of JavaScript. It allows us to directly write 
         HTML in React (within JavaScript code). It is easy to create a template using JSX in React, but it is not a 
         simple template language instead it comes with the full power of JavaScript.
    -Babel
        -Babel is a JavaScript compiler that includes the ability to compile JSX into regular JavaScript You're going to 
         install babel-core slightly differently than you installed react and react-dom. Instead of npm install --save babel-core , 
         you will use the command npm install --save-dev babel-core.
        -In my understanding Babel is converting new syntax into old syntax
    -Webpack
        -Webpack is a static module bundler for JavaScript applications. This enables you to take a fully dynamic application 
         and package it into static files, which you can then upload and deploy to your server
        -Another package for module bundling
